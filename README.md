## Install

Make sure you have MeteorJS (and NodeJS) installed first. Then install dependencies:

```
meteor npm install
```

## Usage

To run the project, execute

```
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 meteor --settings ./dev-settings.json
```

Note: all secrects have been removed using BFG repo-cleaner so that this repo could go public. To be able to upload images in the Dashboard, you would have to provide your own AWS S3 credentials in `.dev-settings.json`.

The project uses a very old version of Meteor--1.5--, which causes expired certificates errors. A workaround, for now, is to run all the meteor commands with the following environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED. (https://docs.meteor.com/expired-certificate.html)

## Heroku

To deploy to Heroku, run (after commiting to master)

```
git push heroku master
```

## Directory layout

The project structure follows the standard MeteorJS (1.5) layout:

```
imports/
  startup/
    client/
      index.js                 # import client startup through a single index entry point
      routes.js                # set up all routes in the app
      useraccounts-configuration.js # configure login templates
    server/
      fixtures.js              # fill the DB with example data on startup
      index.js                 # import server startup through a single index entry point

  api/
    lists/                     # a unit of domain logic
      server/
        publications.js        # all list-related publications
        publications.tests.js  # tests for the list publications
      lists.js                 # definition of the Lists collection
      lists.tests.js           # tests for the behavior of that collection

  ui/
    components/                # all reusable components in the application
                               # can be split by domain if there are many
    layouts/                   # wrapper components for behaviour and visuals
    pages/                     # entry points for rendering used by the router
